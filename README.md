App Idea
App Name: LocalLink

Description:
LocalLink is a mobile app that helps people discover hyper-local events, small businesses, and meetups in their neighborhood. Think of it as a mix between Eventbrite and Nextdoor, but simplified and hyper-targeted for students and young professionals. Users can explore events by category (food, social, professional), follow local creators or organizers, and receive personalized recommendations based on interests and past activity. Key features include location-based feeds, RSVP tracking, and the ability to create/join private group events.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I initially had some trouble with the random color generation and figuring out how to change the background programmatically, but I figured it out through Swift documentation and testing different color configurations.
